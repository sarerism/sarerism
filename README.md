# 👋 Hi, I’m Sareer Ahmed

I’m an OSCP certified security professional with a strong foundation in ethical hacking and cybersecurity. As I embark on my university journey, I’ve decided to broaden my technical skills by learning Java, adding to my proficiency in Python.

## About Me

- 👀 **Primary Interest**: Cybersecurity, particularly penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, and ethical hacking.
- 🛡️ **Certifications**: Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP).
- 🌱 **Currently Learning**: Java to enhance my programming skill set as I prepare for university coursework.
- 💻 **Languages I Know**: Python, and now starting with Java.
- 💼 **Looking to Collaborate On**: Security-related projects, capture-the-flag (CTF) challenges, or anything involving secure coding.
- 📫 **How to Reach Me**: Feel free to contact me via email at `youremail@example.com` or through GitHub.
- ⚡ **Fun Fact**: I love breaking things (in a good way) and then figuring out how to secure them!

## Why This Repository?

Even though security is my primary passion, learning Java will help me understand different paradigms in programming, and I'm sure it will eventually contribute to secure coding practices. This repository serves as a collection of my practice code as I explore Java.

### What’s Inside:

- **Basic Java Concepts**: Control structures, data types, loops, etc.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Class, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.
- **Exception Handling**: Writing robust and error-handling code.
- **Practical Algorithms**: Basic algorithms implemented in Java.

I’ll be updating this repository as I continue learning and experimenting with Java concepts.
